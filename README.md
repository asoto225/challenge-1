# Challenge-1

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This project was built to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards to make the site optimized for search engines. 
- During this project I changed all non-semantic code to semantic code to make it easier to follow. 
- I also added alternative descriptions to all images to make it easier to find on search engines and to have better accessibility for people with disabilities.
- I learned the difference between non-semantic vs semantic code. Also learned how well CSS bounces off the HTML files. Everything needs to link up properly.
